# MLOMesh Discord Roadmap
## Barney Style – Simple Step by Step

---

## The Big Idea

People find your **website** first. Then they join **Discord** for chat, help, and to talk to you. Discord is the last stop—your community hub.

- **Website** = Map, submissions, contact form  
- **Discord** = Chat, support, talking to creators  

Goal: Anyone new should understand your server in under 60 seconds.

---

## Step 1: Welcome New People

When someone joins, they should know where to start.

**Step 1a – Set up #welcome**
1. Click #welcome.
2. Write a short message: "Welcome! This is the MLOMesh Discord. Check the map at mlomesh.vercel.app"
3. Pin that message (right-click → Pin).

**Step 1b – Set up #rules**
1. Click #rules.
2. Write your rules (be nice, no spam, etc.).
3. Pin the rules.

**Step 1c – Optional: #roles**
1. Create a channel called #roles or #pick-your-role.
2. Add a bot that lets people pick roles (Creator, Player) by clicking.
3. Or skip this and assign roles manually.

**Flow:** New person reads #welcome → reads #rules → picks a role (if you have that).

---

## Step 2: Announcements

**Step 2a – Use #announcements**
1. This is where YOU post: site updates, new MLOs, news.
2. Only you (and admins) post here.
3. Keep it short and clear.

**Example:** "New MLO added: [name] by [creator]. Check the map!"

---

## Step 3: General Chat

**Step 3a – #general**
1. For everyone to chat, say hi, ask random questions.
2. No special setup—just let people talk.

**Step 3b – Optional: #showcase**
1. Create #showcase if you want creators to post previews.
2. Skip if you don't need it.

**Step 3c – Optional: #feedback**
1. Create #feedback for suggestions (site, map, Discord).
2. Skip if you're fine without it.

---

## Step 4: Submissions & MLO (The Important One)

**Step 4a – #mlo-submissions**
1. Your website already posts new MLO submissions here.
2. You click Approve or Reject.
3. Make sure your site's DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID points to this channel. Done!

**Step 4b – Optional: #submission-help**
1. Create it if people ask "How do I submit?"
2. Pin a message: "Go to mlomesh.vercel.app/submit to submit your MLO."

**Step 4c – #creator-chat**
1. Create #creator-chat.
2. This is where creators talk to each other and to you.
3. Two-way: they ask, you answer. You ask, they answer.

---

## Step 5: Support

**Step 5a – #support**
1. For questions: "How does the map work?" "How do I add my MLO?"
2. You (or mods) answer here.

**Step 5b – #contact-messages**
1. Your website's contact form already posts here.
2. Make sure DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL points to a webhook in this channel. Done!

**Step 5c – Optional: #creator-support**
1. For creator-specific stuff (tiles, visibility, etc.).
2. Skip if #support is enough.

---

## Step 6: Admin Stuff

**Step 6a – #admin-log**
1. For bot logs (who joined, mod actions).
2. Add a logging bot if you want. Or leave empty.

**Step 6b – #moderation**
1. For mods to discuss reports, bans, appeals.
2. Lock it so only Admins/Moderators see it.

**Step 6c – #admin or #moderator-only**
1. Private channel for you and mods.
2. Lock it: only Admin and Moderator roles can see it.

---

## Step 7: Roles (In Order)

Put roles in this order (top = most powerful):

1. **Admin** (red) – You. Full control.
2. **Moderator** (blue) – Help with rules and support.
3. **Creator** (green) – People with MLOs on the site.
4. **Member** (gray) – Everyone else.
5. **Muted** (dark gray) – For time-outs.

**How to set order:** Server Settings → Roles → drag to reorder.

---

## Step 8: Make It Look Nice

**Step 8a – Category order (top to bottom)**
1. 📢 Announcements  
2. 📜 Rules & Welcome  
3. 💬 General  
4. 📥 Submissions & MLO  
5. 🆘 Support  
6. 🔧 Admin  

Drag categories to reorder.

**Step 8b – Channel topics**
1. Click the gear next to any channel name.
2. Find "Topic."
3. Add a short description.

Examples:
- #general → "Chat and introductions"
- #mlo-submissions → "New MLO submissions from the website"
- #support → "Questions about the site or map? Ask here"
- #creator-chat → "For MLO creators — talk to us and each other"

**Step 8c – Pinned messages**
Pin these so people see them first:
- #welcome → Link to mlomesh.vercel.app
- #rules → Full rules
- #support → "Check the website first: [link]"
- #submission-help (if you have it) → Link to /submit

---

## Step 9: Two-Way Communication (Quick Ref)

**You talking to creators:**
1. #announcements – Big news  
2. #mlo-submissions – Approve/reject, add notes  
3. #creator-chat – Reply to questions  
4. DMs – Private stuff  

**Creators talking to you:**
1. #creator-chat – Questions, feedback  
2. #support – Site/map help  
3. #feedback – Ideas  
4. Contact form on website → Goes to #contact-messages  
5. #submission-help – "How do I submit?"
